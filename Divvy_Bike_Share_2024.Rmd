# üö≤ Introduction: About Divvy

Divvy is Chicago‚Äôs official bike share system, launched in 2013 and operated by **Lyft** in partnership with the **Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT)**. It has grown into one of the largest bike share programs in North America, with:

- Over **800 docking stations** across Chicago and nearby suburbs,
- A fleet of **traditional pedal bikes** and **electric Divvy eBikes**,
- Options for **casual riders** (pay-as-you-go) and **annual members**.

Divvy continues expanding its network and electrified fleet, while aiming to convert more casual users into long-term members. This analysis uses full-year trip data from 2024 to explore ridership trends and support Divvy‚Äôs business goals.

## üéØ Project Goals

This project answers key business questions:

1. **How do annual members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?**
2. **Why would casual riders buy annual memberships?**
3. **How can Divvy use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?**

We will use R to process, clean, analyze, and visualize real trip data, leading to insights and marketing recommendations.

# üîç Key Insights

## ‚úÖ How do annual members and casual riders differ?

Casual riders tend to:

* Ride more on weekends.
* Take longer trips.
* Use bikes for recreation.

Annual members are more likely to:

* Ride during weekdays.
* Take shorter trips.
* Use bikes for commuting or errands.

## üí° Why might casual riders convert to membership?

* Regular weekend riders could save money by switching to an annual plan.
* Convenience: easier access, no per-ride hassle.
* Better value for frequent short rides.

## üì£ Digital Marketing Strategy Suggestions

* Targeted ads on weekends showing savings based on their usage.
* Promote features like unlock speed and exclusive stations.
* Offer trial discounts during peak casual riding months (e.g., summer).

## üìå Conclusion

Divvy can grow its annual membership base by:

* Understanding behavioral patterns,
* Personalizing offers based on usage,
* Making value propositions clear through data-driven digital media.
